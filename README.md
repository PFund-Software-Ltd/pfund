PFund (/piː fʌnd/), which stands for "Personal Fund", is an algo-trading framework designed for using machine learning models to trade across TradFi (Traditional Finance, e.g. Interactive Brokers), CeFi (Centralized Finance, e.g. Binance) and DeFi (Decentralized Finance, e.g. [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange)), or in simple terms, **Stocks** and **Cryptos**.

PFund allows traders to:
- perform vectorized or event-driven backtesting with
  - different resolutions of data, e.g. orderbook data, tick data, bar data etc.
  - different data tools, e.g. pandas, [polars](https://pola.rs/) etc.
- train machine learning models using their favorite frameworks, i.e. PFund is **ML-framework agnostic**
- tune strategy (hyper)parameters by splitting data into training sets, development sets and test sets
- go from backtesting to live trading by just changing **ONE line of code!!**

It is created to enable trading for [PFund.ai](https://pfund.ai) - a trading platform that bridges algo-trading and manual trading using AI (LLM).

Since PFund's sole purpose is for trading only, for all the data work, there is a separate library to handle that: \

## Project Status
**_Caution: PFund is at a VERY EARLY stage, use it at your own risk._**

PFund is currently under active development, the framework design will be prioritized first over
stability and scalability. 

Please note that the available version is a *dev* version, not a *stable* one. \
You are encouraged to play with the *dev* version, but only use it when a *stable* version is released.

> PFund for the time being **_only supports vectorized backtesting_** using [Bybit](https://bybit.com/) and Yahoo Finance data for testing purpose.


## Mission
As an algo-trader, if you aim to quickly try out some trading ideas to see if they work, and if they do, deploy them for live traidng, it is actually not a trivial task since it involves multiple stages:
- Ideation
- Strategy development
- Backtesting
- Model development (if using machine learning)
- Model training (if using machine learning)
- Parameter training / hyperparameter tuning
- Strategy deployment
- Portfolio monitoring

This overview already omits some intricate steps, such as data handling and API integration.

> PFund's mission is to **_enable traders to concentrate solely on strategy formulation_** while the framework manages the rest. With PFund serving as the core trade engine, it empowers retail traders to have a fund management experience on [PFund.ai](https://pfund.ai) as if they are operating their personal hedge fund, hence the name *PFund*.


## Core Features
- [x] Easily switch environments with just one line of code, transitioning from backtesting to live trading
- [x] Supports machine learning models, features, technical analysis indicators
- [x] Both Strategy() and Model() are treated as first-class citizens
- [x] Offers LEGO-style strategy and model building, allowing strategies to add other strategies, models to add other models
- [x] Streamlines the algo-trading flow, from vectorized backtesting for strategy prototyping and event-driven backtesting for strategy development, to live trading for strategy deployment
- [x] Enables parallel data processing, e.g. Interactive Brokers and Binance each have their own process for receiving data feeds
- [ ] Allows choosing your preferred data tool, e.g. pandas, polars, pyspark etc.
- [ ] Features a modern frontend using [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/) and TradingView's Charts library



## Installation
### Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) (Recommended)
```bash
poetry add pfund
```


### Using Pip
```bash
pip install pfund
```


## Quick Start
### Backtesting
```python
import pfund as pf

# NOTE: for more exciting strategies, please visit pfund.ai
class YourStrategy(pf.Strategy):
    # triggered by bar/kline data (e.g. 1-minute data)
    def on_bar(self):
        # write your trading logic here
        pass

engine = pf.BacktestEngine(...)
strategy = engine.add_strategy(YourStrategy())
strategy.add_data(...)
strategy.add_model(...)
engine.run()
```


### Live Trading
> Just change one line of code, from '**BacktestEngine**' to '**TradeEngine**'. BOOM! you can now start live trading.
```python
import pfund as pf

engine = pf.TradeEngine(env='LIVE')
strategy = engine.add_strategy(YourStrategy())
strategy.add_data(...)
strategy.add_model(...)
engine.run()
```

### Parameter Training / Hyperparameter Tuning
> The correct term should be "Hyperparameter Tuning", but since not all traders are familiar with machine learning, the framework uses a more well-known term "training".

```python
import pfund as pf

engine = pf.TrainEngine()
strategy = engine.add_strategy(...)
strategy.add_data(...)
strategy.add_indicator(...)
engine.run()
```

### Building LEGO-Style Strategy and Model
```python
import pfund as pf

engine = pf.TradeEngine(env='LIVE')
strategy = engine.add_strategy(...)
strategy.add_data(...)
model = strategy.add_model(...)

model.add_data(...)  # using different data than strategy's
sub_model = model.add_model(...)  # YES, model can add another model to its use
# You can keep going: 
# sub_sub_model = sub_model.add_model(...)

engine.run()
```


## Model Hub
Imagine a space where algo-traders can share their machine learning models with one another.
Strategy and model development could be so much faster since you can build on top of an existing working model.
> Model Hub is coming soon in [PFund.ai](https://pfund.ai), Stay Tuned!
